# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Deployment Strategy

## Build Process
1. Prepare for Production
2. Code Optimization:
   - Implement code splitting for improved loading times
   - Optimize assets (compress images, minify CSS/JS)
   - Set up proper caching headers for static assets

## Hosting Options
Option 1: Hosting with AWS
1. S3 + CloudFront Deployment
    - Upload build files to an S3 bucket
    - Configure CloudFront for global CDN distribution
    - Set up HTTPS with AWS Certificate Manager
2. Automated Deployment with CI/CD

Option 2: Containerized Deployment
1. Create a Dockerfile
2. Deploy to AWS ECS or Kubernetes for container orchestration

Option 3: Hosting with Azure
1. Azure Blob storage or Azure App service
2. Automated Deployment with CI/CD
